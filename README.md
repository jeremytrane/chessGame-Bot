# ♟️ Deep Dive Python Chess Engine + Bot

Build a complete, FIDE-legal chess engine and bot in Python from scratch — no external libraries for game logic. This project is a full educational and engineering deep dive into chess programming and AI.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Implementation:
- A full chess rules engine (pieces, board, moves, special rules)
- Terminal-based gameplay
- A custom-built chess bot using Minimax + Alpha-Beta pruning
- An optional GUI (Pygame, Tkinter, etc.)
- Clean architecture, full test coverage, and deep rule enforcement

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Language: **Python**
- Interface: **Terminal (CLI)** → Optional: GUI (Pygame/Tkinter)
- Libraries: None for logic (built from scratch), optional for UI
- Bot: Custom **Minimax** with **alpha-beta pruning**

## 📋 Roadmap

### ✅ PHASE 1 — Board Representation & Core Structures
- [ ] Define board structure (`8x8` or 1D list of 64 squares)
- [ ] Create enums/constants for pieces and colors
- [ ] Implement `Piece` class with type, color, has_moved
- [ ] Implement `Move` class to represent all move metadata
- [ ] Initialize and print the starting board

---

### ♟️ PHASE 2 — Piece Movement & Move Generation
- [ ] Implement movement rules for:
  - [ ] Pawn (incl. captures, double push)
  - [ ] Knight
  - [ ] Bishop
  - [ ] Rook
  - [ ] Queen
  - [ ] King (incl. castling)
- [ ] Generate pseudo-legal moves
- [ ] Implement legal move filtering:
  - [ ] King safety
  - [ ] Pinned pieces
  - [ ] Discovered checks

---

### ⚖️ PHASE 3 — Rule Enforcement
- [ ] En passant (timing, legality)
- [ ] Castling (rook/king unmoved, check rules)
- [ ] Pawn promotion (default to queen, later user choice)
- [ ] Threefold repetition detection
- [ ] 50-move rule
- [ ] Check/checkmate/stalemate detection

---

### 🎮 PHASE 4 — Game Management & CLI
- [ ] Turn system
- [ ] Input parsing (e.g., `e2e4`)
- [ ] Output clean board state
- [ ] Move validation
- [ ] Undo/redo move stack
- [ ] Move history
- [ ] Save/load games (optional PGN format)

---

### 🧠 PHASE 5 — Evaluation Function
- [ ] Material score
- [ ] Piece-square tables
- [ ] Pawn structure (doubled, isolated, passed)
- [ ] King safety
- [ ] Mobility
- [ ] Normalize score per side to move

---

### 🤖 PHASE 6 — Bot Logic
- [ ] Implement Minimax search (recursive)
- [ ] Add Alpha-Beta pruning
- [ ] Add iterative deepening
- [ ] Add quiescence search
- [ ] Add move ordering (captures first, killer moves)
- [ ] Time-based or depth-based limits

---

### ⚙️ PHASE 7 — Optimization & Testing
- [ ] Modularize code (board, game, logic, bot)
- [ ] Profile for performance bottlenecks
- [ ] Add unit tests for:
  - [ ] Movement rules
  - [ ] Special cases
  - [ ] Game result detection
- [ ] Add logging/debug mode
- [ ] Document functions and architecture
- [ ] Add type hints

---

### 🎨 PHASE 8 — Optional GUI
- [ ] Choose GUI library: Pygame / Tkinter / PyQt
- [ ] Render board and pieces
- [ ] Handle drag-and-drop or click input
- [ ] Show check/mate/stalemate
- [ ] Play against bot in GUI

---

### 🧠 Core Concepts to Learn Along the Way
- Bitboards vs arrays (you'll use arrays here)
- Chess engine search trees
- Alpha-beta pruning
- Evaluation heuristics
- Game state management
- Clean architecture and separation of concerns

## 🧮 Evaluation Formula (Example)

```python
def evaluate(board):
    return (
        material_score(board) +
        position_bonus(board) +
        king_safety(board) +
        mobility_score(board)
    )
